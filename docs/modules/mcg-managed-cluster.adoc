== Allow ACM to deploy the managed cluster application to a subset of clusters

By default the `clusterGroup` applications are deployed on all clusters that ACM knows about. In your `value-hub.yaml` file add a `managedClusterCgroup` for each cluster or group of clusters that you want to manage as one.

[source,yaml]
----
  managedClusterGroups:
  - name: region-one
    helmOverrides:
    - name: clusterGroup.isHubCluster
      value: false
    clusterSelector:
      matchLabels:
        clusterGroup: region-one
----

The above yaml segment will deploy the `clusterGroup` applications on managed clusters with the label
`clusterGroup=region-one`.  Specific subscriptions and Operators, applications and projects for that `clusterGroup` are then managed in a `value-region-one.yaml` file. E.g.

[source,yaml]
----
  namespaces:
    - config-demo

  projects:
    - config-demo

  applications:
    config-demo:
      name: config-demo
      namespace: config-demo
      project: config-demo
      path: charts/all/config-demo

  #Subscriptions can be added too - multicloud-gitops at present does not require subscriptions on its managed clusters
  #subscriptions:
.  #  example-subscription
  #    name: example-operator
  #    namespace: example-namespace
  #    channel: example-channel
  #    csv: example-operator.v1.0.0

== Deploy a managed cluster

Rather than provide instructions on creating a managed cluster it is assumed
that an OpenShift cluster has already been created. Use the `openshift-install` program provided at https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create[cloud.redhat.com]

There are a three ways to join the managed cluster to the management hub.

* Using the ACM user interface
* Using the `cm` tool
* Using the `clusteradm` tool

== Managed cluster setup using the ACM UI

After ACM is installed a message regarding a "Web console update is available" may be displayed.
Click on the "Refresh web console" link.

image::/images/web-console-update-message.png[update-web-console]

On the upper-left side you'll see a pull down labeled "local-cluster". Select "All Clusters" from this pull down.
This will navigate to the ACM console and to its "Clusters" section

image::/images/local-all-cluster-pulldown.png[launch-acm-console]

Select the "Import cluster" option beside the highlighted Create Cluster button.

image::/images/import-cluster.png[import-cluster]

On the "Import an existing cluster" page, enter the cluster name and choose Kubeconfig as the "import mode". Add the tag `clusterGroup=region-one`. Press import. Done.

Using this method, you are done. Skip to the section <<managed-cluster-is-joined,Managed cluster is joined>> but ignore the part about adding the site tag.

[id="managed-cluster-setup-using-cm-tool-managed-cluster"]
== Managed cluster setup using `cm` tool

. Install the `cm` (cluster management) command-line tool. See details https://github.com/open-cluster-management/cm-cli/#installation[here]
. Obtain the KUBECONFIG file from the managed-cluster cluster.
. On the command-line login into the management hub cluster (use `oc login` or export the KUBECONFIG).
. Run the following command:

[,sh]
----
cm attach cluster --cluster <cluster-name> --cluster-kubeconfig <path-to-KUBECONFIG>
----

[id="managed-cluster-setup-using-clusteradm-tool-managed-cluster"]
== Managed cluster setup using `clusteradm` tool

You can also use `clusteradm` to join a cluster. The following instructions explain what needs to be done. `clusteradm` is still in testing.

. To deploy a edge cluster you will need to get the management hub cluster's token. You will need to install `clusteradm`.  On the existing _management hub cluster_:
+
`clusteradm get token`

. When you run the `clusteradm` command above it replies with the token and also shows you the command to use on the managed cluster. So first you must login to the managed cluster
+
`oc login`
or
+
`export KUBECONFIG=~/my-ocp-env/managed-cluster`

. Then request to that the managed cluster join the management hub
+
`clusteradm join --hub-token <token from clusteradm get token command > <managed cluster name>`

. Back on the hub cluster accept the join request
+
`clusteradm accept --clusters <managed-cluster-name>`

=== Designate the new cluster as a managed cluster site

Now that ACM is no longer deploying the managed cluster applications everywhere, we need
to explicitly indicate that the new cluster has the managed cluster role. *If you haven't tagged the cluster* as `clusterGroup=region-one` then we can that here.

We do this by adding the label referenced in the managedSite's `clusterSelector`.

. Find the new cluster
+
`oc get managedcluster.cluster.open-cluster-management.io`

. Apply the label
+
`oc label managedcluster.cluster.open-cluster-management.io/YOURCLUSTER site=managed-cluster`

=== You're done

That's it! Go to your managed cluster (edge) OpenShift console and check for the open-cluster-management-agent pod being launched. Be patient, it will take a while for the ACM agent and agent-addons to launch. After that, the operator OpenShift GitOps will run. When it's finished coming up launch the OpenShift GitOps (ArgoCD) console from the top right of the OpenShift console.
