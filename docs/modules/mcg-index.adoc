== Background

Organizations are looking for a way to develop and deploy applications on an open hybrid cloud in a stable, simple, and secure way. This hybrid approach includes multi-cloud deployments where workloads may be running on different clusters on different clouds - private or public. This also requires an infrastructure-as-code approach that manages versions and being able to deploy based on specific deployment configurations.

The pattern is derived from work done by the https://gitlab.com/redhatdemocentral/portfolio-architecture-examples/-/blob/main/spi-multi-cloud-gitops.adoc[Red Hat Portfolio Architecture team]

At a high level this requires a management hub, for DevOps and GitOps, and infrastructure that extends to more than one managed clusters running on private or public clouds.
